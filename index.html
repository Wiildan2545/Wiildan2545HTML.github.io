	<h4>My Story</h4>
		<p>My name was given by both my parents when I was born on Wednesday, July 25, 2001. This name has the meaning of Responsible, protect, care, community, balanced, and sympathetic.
		</p>

		<p>I have many friends one of my most remembered friends is my friend at seventh grade. I have a very kind, friendly, honest and funny friend. We even made a group. This group consists of 5 people and named UKS "Ucup Keseleo Squad". The time when I was with them was very fun.</p>

	About My Best Friend</a></p>

	<p>And now I will tell you about my friend in Year eight. To be honest, my friend in eighth grade is not as much as in seventh grade. Because in the eighth grade the number of students is more women than men.</p>
	<p>But in the eighth grade I have some sahabay ie mahdi.dhani.bima.tomy dll. We often play together at mahdi's house and we often call our name group as FTF, in fact I also do not know the meaning, but I it's okay for me.</p>
	<p>Then when the ninth grade is the most mengasikan class because my friend is very much, not only in one class, I also have friends in other class. As class I have 2 BestCamp at home Shidiq and Ica House. But I often play in shidiq's house rather than Ica House. Now I have many friends also SMAKBO. Honestly I am very proud when I entered SMAKBO and I am also very happy to be able to go to school here.</p>
